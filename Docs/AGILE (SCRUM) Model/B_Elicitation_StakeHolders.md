# Task B: Identification of Elicitation Techniques for each of the stakeholders.

## End Users

### End users are the most direct source of information about how a system will be used. The best elicitation techniques for them involve direct interaction and observation.

- **Questionnaire:** Because we can get to know what features the user expects from the app.
- **Naturalistic Observation/Ethnography:**  Observing end users in their natural work environment is crucial for uncovering requirements that they may not think to mention. This technique helps us to personalize their feed by examining the pattern of their interests.
- **Interviews:** Interviews with end users allow for a one-on-one or group discussion to understand user expectations and needs. Through open-ended questions, you can gain deep insights and discover nuanced ideas. It also allows us to Record information to be used as input to requirements analysis and modeling, Discover information from interviewee accurately and efficiently and Reassure interviewee that his/her understanding of the topic has been explored, listened to, and valued.

##  News Publishers
### News publishers are key stakeholders as they are the source of the content your app will aggregate. The techniques for them should focus on understanding their business processes, content management needs, and strategic goals.

- **Questionnaire:**  To get the specific data(title,description,time) from the News Provider(API). 
- **Studying Document:**  Reviewing existing publisher documentation, such as content style guides, API documentation, and Language, can provide valuable insights into their current processes. 

## Developers
### Developers are concerned with the technical feasibility and implementation of the system. The elicitation techniques for them should focus on providing clear, structured requirements.

- **Studying Documentation:** This technique involves creating detailed scenarios that describe how users interact with the system. Use cases are valuable for developers because they help identify system actors and the specific interactions needed to accomplish goals. This structured approach provides a clear roadmap for what needs to be built.
- **Prototyping:** Prototyping allows developers to explore the feasibility of certain features and understand what a product should look like before a single line of code is written. It helps them visualize the requirements and ensures that the software design aligns with user expectations.
- **Joint Application Design (JAD):** JAD is a technique that brings together stakeholders, including developers, in a collaborative workshop to define requirements and make decisions. This method helps to bridge the "expectation gap" and ensures that developers have a shared understanding of the project's goals.
- **Interviews:** Could help exploring the issue and solve them at the earliest.

## Product Manager
### Product managers are responsible for the overall product vision and strategy. Their elicitation techniques should enable them to gather a holistic view from all stakeholder groups.
- **Naturalistic Observation:** It would help manager to track the user activity.
- **Interviews:** Product managers can conduct interviews with a wide range of stakeholders, from end users to executive sponsors, to understand different perspectives and priorities. They should ask questions to clarify the "why" behind requirements to ensure the app provides true business value.
- **Workshops:** Workshops are an effective way to facilitate group discussions and collaboration among different stakeholders. A product manager can lead workshops to brainstorm ideas, define project scope, and prioritize requirements based on business value and user needs.

## Test Engineers
### Test engineers need specific and detailed requirements to create test cases and ensure the system's quality.
- **Prototyping:** Test engineers can use prototypes to conduct preliminary testing and provide feedback early in the development cycle. By interacting with the prototype, they can identify potential usability issues, functional gaps, and design flaws before significant resources have been invested in development.
- **Document Analysis:** Test engineers can review and analyze existing project documentation, such as requirement specifications and use cases, to understand the system's intended behavior. This technique provides a clear foundation for creating test plans and test cases.
- **Interview:**  It would help developers to know what the major bugs are in the system along with the vulnerability
