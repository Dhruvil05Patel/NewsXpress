# Task D: User Stories (INVEST Compliant Backlog)

## User Authentication Epic

### US1: Account Registration & Email Verification
### Front of the Card
> **As a New User, I want to register using my basic information and verify my email so that I can create and activate my account securely.**

### Back of the Card
* **Primary Actor:** User
* **Given** the user provides valid **Name**, **Email**, **Username**, and **Password**
    * **When** they submit the registration form
    * **Then** the system creates an **unverified account entry**.
* **Given** the user enters an email that is already registered
    * **When** they attempt to register
    * **Then** the system displays an **“Email already exists”** message.
* **Given** the user enters a username that is taken or violates username rules
    * **When** they attempt to register
    * **Then** the system displays a message indicating the **username is unavailable or invalid**.
* **Given** the user enters a password that does not meet the required constraints (min length 8, uppercase, lowercase, digit, special character)
    * **When** the user attempts registration
    * **Then** the system **rejects the password** and displays **password guidelines**.
* **Given** the account was successfully created
    * **When** the system finalizes registration
    * **Then** the system **sends a verification email** containing a **verification link**.
* **Given** the user clicks the verification link
    * **When** the link is **valid**
    * **Then** the system updates the account status to **Verified**.

---

### US2: User Login
### Front of the Card
> **As a Registered User, I want to log into my account securely so that I can access my personalized news and features.**

### Back of the Card
* **Primary Actor:** User

    * **When** they attempt to log in
    * **Then** the system **authenticates the user**.
* **Given** the user enters incorrect email or password
    * **When** they attempt to log in
    * **Then** the system displays an **“Invalid email or password”** message.
* **Given** the user’s account is not verified
    * **When** they enter correct credentials
    * **Then** the system **prevents login** and displays a **“Please verify your email”** message.
* **Given** the user logs in from another device
    * **When** they enter valid credentials
    * **Then** the system **grants secure access** to their account.

---

### US3: Password Reset
### Front of the Card
> **As a user, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access if I forget it.**

### Back of the Card
* **Primary Actor:** User
* **Given** the user enters a registered and verified email
    * **When** they request password reset
    * **Then** the system sends an email with a reset link.
* **Given** the reset link is valid
    * **When** the user enters a new password
    * **Then** the system updates the password and confirms success.

### US4: Authentication Persistence
### Front of the Card

    * **When** they revisit the page
    * **Then** the system automatically restores their session.
* **Given** the user manually logs out
    * **When** they reopen the website
    * **Then** the system does not restore the session and shows the login page.
* **Given** the user resets their password
    * **When** the system attempts session restore
    * **Then** it invalidates the old session and requires fresh login.
* **Given** the user is unverified

### Back of the Card
* **Primary Actor:** System Admin (Functionality executes during US2a)
* **Given** the username field has constraints (e.g., 6-18 characters, alphanumeric/underscore only)
    * **When** the user enters a username that **meets all constraints** and **is not already taken**
    * **Then** the system provides immediate visual confirmation (e.g., a green checkmark) that the username is available and valid.
* **Given** the user is attempting to register
    * **When** the user enters a username that is **already in use** by another account
    * **Then** the system displays an error message indicating the name is unavailable (e.g., "This username is taken. Please choose another.").
* **Given** the constraints require only specific characters
